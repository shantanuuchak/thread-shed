# Thread Shed Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves parsing and analyzing sales data from a sewing supply store called "Thread Shed." The data is stored in a single, complex string that includes customer names, sales amounts, thread colors, and sale dates. The goal is to clean and organize this data into separate lists for customers, sales, and thread colors, calculate the total sales for the day, and determine the number of threads sold for each color.

## Key Tasks

1. **Data Parsing**: Replace artifacts in the string and split it into individual transactions.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary whitespace from each data point.
3. **Data Organization**: Separate the cleaned data into lists for customers, sales, and thread colors.
4. **Sales Calculation**: Calculate the total sales amount for the day.
5. **Thread Color Analysis**: Count the number of threads sold for each color.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter to see the output of total sales and thread color counts.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice string manipulation and list operations in Python.
- Gain experience in basic data analysis and organization.
- Develop skills in cleaning and processing raw data for analysis.

This project is a practical exercise in handling and analyzing real-world data using Python, focusing on string operations and list management.
